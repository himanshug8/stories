**What should a writer write about:**  
I was studying to be a writer and a director, and while doing so i noticed a pattern. A pattern that a Biologist, a Botanist, many aged actors, and many people in the world who are unrelated to the writing were writing books, and were getting published; i thought to myself how lucky they are, that they are getting published.  

---
Then i wrote some bad short stories as a beginner should on A guy dealing with depression, A guy looks for pattern in randomness, An orphan tries to find his parents, A guy looking for a bird, and many many more work inspired from multiple writer director, nd first one was [Terrence Malick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film)) , All sorts of ideas bloomed from his film `The tree of life`, Then the usual ones that every film lover falls onto like, Christopher nolan, Martin Scorsese, Charlie kaufman, David fincher, Ridley scott, All the Marvel films, DC Films, any film that was grabbing the oscar. The desire to make a film was peaking and all the attempts were failing, i seemed to meet people who were a mix of their favorite writers and i found all the same pattern with in my writing as well, it got me thinking..  

---
My writing style is a mix of Terrence Malick mix with the absurdity of Charlie Kaufman further mix with so on so on... Then i thought about if every one i meet is a mix of someone the the writers we were mix of were also mix of someone. Then I thought to follow up and see if its true.

I should stablish that I was born in india and influence of Bollywood was on to me like it was onto everyone around me, my early definition of love, family dynamic, concept of a having a friend and the kind of girl i need in my life came from bollywood, until it begin to taint my reality because i paid attention to everything and i found out people around me were a personality i have seen in some bollywood movie, my uncle and aunt, the nagging behavior and using sarcasm to make jokes, and when my hormones exploded suddenly bollywood movies sucked me right in, and it played on me for years it feed my desires until in college, after watching a documentary named The Salt of the Earth on a photographer named Sebasti√£o Salgado something changed in me, I thought about this documentary a lot, what a great person and a photographer he is and he gave his life to document something which mattered. and i thought to myself that he should write a book. Then it hit me.....

----
it hit me, like one should live a life worth writing about.and now any bollywood film i watched felt disgusting and because it feed on my desires i anyway watched them a lot, until i realized that watching bollywood movies somehow making me horny and perverted but whereas hollywood film even though they have more open sexual intercourse were some how leaving with a life lesson.

---
It was weird that every bollywood film made me want to have a girlfriend like that shown in the film, even though Three idiots was inspiring my mind only wanted that version of Kareena Kapoor in my life, she is a doctor and looks really really [hot](https://youtu.be/V056WNg3ECo?t=134) when she wears saree in the rain and stretches herself. This is the most sane example in my list of bollywood films.
when it comes to sex bollywood films are teasing you by showing you something that going to happen in the end and then not show you, you left unfulfilled even though the hero get the girl you are left with mild erection.
Where as in the Hollywood, sex is something so casual that it is not an important part of the characters life, they do it in a frenzy,they do it when need, every sex scene has some consequences effect on the film. for example if you see one of the character in the movie is a stripper your mind will want to see her strip, in hollywood you get it and in bollywood you don't. Same for war, if you see the great tension building between nation, by the end of the movie your mind want to see that war happening, you will be disappointed if you dont see the was and someone sacrifices himself to stop the war that was bubbling throught the film, thats another film where a guy sacrifices himself to stop the war, then your mind doestn want to see the war happening becasue this is a film about a guy stopping a war at any cause now you mind want that war to stop. You are war friendly when you see a war film, you are against war when you are watching an anty war movies. so, When you see a stripper in a movie your mind want her to strip and when you see a lady who discovered radium, you mind want to see her getting the nobel prize. 
That is the mainstream cinema is about, it tosses you around, feed on you thinking pattern, it let you anticipate something and then avoid giving you or give you something that fucking changes your life. for me it was the documentary I saw The salt of the earth, that changed the direction of life, suddenly i wanted to be a filmmaker who mattered, but was applying every formula that i sucked while watching hollywood and bollywood films.

There were lot of illusions around me and the life i was choosing and dealing with that took many years of my life, i was angry, i was in anxiety and overly ambitious guy.
Then i remember that I don't like what I am writing because i am a mix of my favorite writers. And i wanted to write something original. What is original work, thats another post. But i begun to analyze my favorite writers.  
* Christopher nolan : obsessed with time and physics, so he writes movie about it.
* Charlie Kaufman : inspired from absurd theater, he looks for absurd in the reality we live in adn he writes movie about it.
* Martin scorsese : He as inspired from his neighborhood, which included italian gangsters, violence, suits then a mature side of exploring spirituality in his life because he has seen this much of violence.
* Terrence malick: He was a philosophy student and choose to explore philosophy through cinema.
* David lynch : He just wanted to make live paintings through cinema, so you don't try to make sense what you are watching because they are the expression of his life experience and tainted childhood. He ones saw a naked women on the street heavily under the influence of drugs. Many visuals in his films are inspired from his tainted life.
* Paul thomas andresson : He loves 70s and because he was born at that time, he had seen mentally ill soldiers, and the rise of scientology, and era of porn. so he make movies about that.

and i am sitting in a dark room, thinking what kind of films i want to make about, then as i was figuring the course of my life, living the harsh experiences few movie came to me as i lived, i cant help but to write it.

But you cant eternally suffer and then write about it, it took a toll on my life. I don't want to suffer and then write about it. its exhausting. but i bagged three films in two years that i really believed in.

But when i rid myself from the suffering, the movie ideas that i wrote made no sense. Because i concluded that. To live is to suffer and to survive is to find meaning in the suffering and i believed it for so long but then when i rid myself from the suffering, i find this sentence absurd. that to live it to suffer, such a fucked up statement but a highly popular one. You must have came across it, all you have to do is understand what is it that suffers and what is this suffering.

So, when I rid myself of suffering i discovered new set of filmmakers that inspired my life.
They were, Werner herzog, Bergman, andrey tarkvosky, godard, satyajeet ray, roy andression, Lars von Trier,
Leos Carax, and recently wim winders. one thing common with them is they dont work under the pressure of the profit, they are exploring life through cinema. They are documenting the glory of living and documenting the entrophy as it unfolds. The are exploring the very human condition  that the mainstream uses againts you. they are the soldiers of life and i am to.

So, what should a writer write about. The truth is a writer doesn't exist and don't ever try to be a writer. You life a life worth documenting. you see the truth was always with me when five year back i saw that documentary and an insight came to me that live a life worth documenting, it was tainted by the million illusions that are around you. it took me five years and you can see it in five minutes by this post.

----
so, you should live a life worth documenting, and worth is something you decide. Maybe you want to study trees, maybe you want to study stars, maybe you want to study crime, maybe you are a mountain climber or anything and anyone other then writer, then you will have something to write about. Because you are living a life unique to everyone else, if you dont count the suffering part because its common among us, right.
But the moment you become a writer, you are fucked, because a writer is just a guy who play with words. but even if you dont play with words you will feel the need to write whatever you life is, maybe you are a person who was stuck in space cough! sunita wiliams cough!, and you want to write what you did stucking in the space, beacause you cant help but write it, because you lived it. Now a writer will come and take your story and write it in a way that pleases millions of people and every one will earn millions.

You see, just a writer causes harm to our society. because he doesnt know what to do with his skills. so he does weverything in illusion. because just a writer is a person with glorified words, he uses them where he can. 
But you who is living a life, is a writer if you choose to.
By now, you should see all the films schools are scam and all the art films they make in the name of cinema is also shit.
just a director is an empty guy with great knowledge to direct,
just a writer a an empty guy with  tallent to use words
just a cinematographer is a guy with a camera who know how to take empty beaautiful shots.

they together look for tallented people like you who are doing interesting work and use their work to fill themself because they are utterly empty.

so, decide for yourself because another truth is these empty writer,director will earn more then you ever will, but you on the other hand life a life of fulfilment, not divorses, sex, and cigarettes and glory.
