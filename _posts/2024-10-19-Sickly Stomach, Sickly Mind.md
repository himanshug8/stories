I lay on my bed, felt the stiff muscle all over the body, my mind eased into the bed and the body stretched itself from tip to toe and I relaxed even more.
I turned my head, looked at the wall clock. It's one in the afternoon. I looked away, lied blank. The fan was fluttering. the clock was ticking.
The sun was up and shining and I was protected by a large tree that was blocking the sun.uio
winter is coming and the owner had chopped parts of its thick branch for the sunbaths for himself. <!-- its has the s because it is used in terms of belonging not verb. -->
I looked at this freshly chopped thick branch, the wound was fresh and flies were onto it hovering around, sucking the life off it. Adjacent to the wound was another wounded but healed amputated branch. means it has suffered this before.

in between the dense leaves a patch of it was fluttering. I looked for the wind but it was not there. I scanned the branch and found a squirrel cleaning itself passionately using it's nose and cheek by constantly rubbing against it's tummy and by twisting cleaning it's back.
It begin to eat its collected food. i can't se what it was but by the looks of it , it was enjoying it-self.
When it was done eating. it began its business. For some reason it started to squeak and as the intensity increased its tail wagged with it. the squeaking intensity increasing and decreasing making its furry tail looked like a harmonious piano piece.
After a while it moved and jumped to another branch and started to squeak. Seemed like alerting someone about something.

I wondered if they have language like we do. Its not possible, they do have signals for different things but not the complex structure od languages like we do.

it jumped again onto the another branch, squeaked for another few minutes. I found it painful that it is squealing for almost fifteen minutes and by the end i can sense pain in its voice.
and finding it flat onto a fat thick branch. for the first time it looked at me, and it was tired. i looked at it. it looked at me. it yawned. I yawned. Before i can finally sleep it hit me, maybe someone close to it dies yesterday, when the owner chopped the branch. Maybe it was looking for its mate and it is also true that for the first time in my life i saw a squirrel alone on a big old tree.
I got up pulled out few hazelnuts from the package and tossed it outside for it to pick.
I returned the package to its proper place when my eyes placed on a cat with patchy brown and white fur sleeping in the open alone. The sunlight shined on it's fur and the old tree leaves were casting shadow on its face. I went to my desk and got distracted.
