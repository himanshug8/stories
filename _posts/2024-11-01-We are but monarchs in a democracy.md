Monarchy existed for thousands of year, choose any civilization and you will find monarchy, hindu mythology to greek mythology, the longest living system till now is monarchy.

**BUT WHY...?**

Initially tribes needed a leader to make quick decision for hunting and gathering stuff for survival and as the time excelled, so does the simple leading position to a whole complex system of monarchy stablished itself.

It fueled for centuries when somewhere, someone in rome, to be specific a king started to use a system related to democracy, where people are not at the mercy of their king but a society where they have some say to their freedom.

**How this information is relevant to indian people?**

*- midset of monarchy we suffered islamic invasion, a babur looking for power and to prove its worth to his father and to keep the name of gengiz khan alive through capturing larger lands*  
*- after islamic invasion a few century of british cruel and manipulative invasion*

Lets pause for a second and think about common people, who were under monarchy, looked up to thier king even thhough he was raping their daughter and striping them of their wealth and sometime in a century they get to see a godly ruler who really chanded the way his kingdom worked the agan after the death his asshole son or some other king who won over bu is naturally cruel begin to rule. so people were really at hte mersy of their king.

then atop that an islamic invasion, more cruel and totally differnet cultural context was stablished and smeared on top of the people of hinduism and that to for centuries.
then british came and they were more different creatures who used manuplation and buisness as a ruling technique for us. "it was called british india"

people didint even know that they can ever live with freedom, they thought someone or the other is going to rule them anyway, they have accepted it but few indian men who can read their language finally get to know about democracy and the power of voting and that a nation can be free and that their can be nation. they invested their life to make the country free, and afte countless sacrifises our nation gets to see the light in the freedon for centuries.
right. few men decided that we were free. adn we really were. but what about phychologiacl freedom and a monarch mind set that people hold in theri heart.

they are middle class people now living in a democracy as a monarch. they have a small house but they want their si\on to have a boy so that the blood line can be saved. 
they have a greater image that their sone earns in lakhs more then anyone in their known relatives and society. they want theri women in the kitchen and nowhere else. they check the women face before getting married to ther son, even the girls father give dowry. why is that. people who were in the part of islamic ivasion adn then bristish inc\vasion, stills survive in the democracy.

it is because, their is something which is conditining. you are what your father was plus few  other people you surrounds with. same with your father who was like his father plus who he surrounds himself with right. ayou can go way way back and find that the fear that one of your anscestor used to fell when a islamic boss used to beath the hell out of you ansestor to work quickly. to him teaching his kid to work quickly to save him from this fucking opperesor and noy to you who is living ina free country still doing every task ina frisk manner becasue completion of a task somehow relax you. why is that. its because the anxiety of your century old ansastor which was real has transfered to you. it need a lot of attenting to see your wiring and learning that runs in your family because you liked it or not you are going to ick some ugly and god things rom your father and mother.

recent example would be. that your parents are way sarcastic and you hate it and then you find yourself using ugly sarcasy to hurt others. the same thing you hate, has you and you use it. see. for every situation their can be, their are countles way to react to it. but if yo are aware of whats happeneing arounf you respond, seing what you are going to react. look in oyur life if you parents are also monarch, if you ar ereading this means you are not i guess. but parents are, and maybe when you grow up you finnd yourself forsing your kids to marry like your father is doing now. so we have to break the condition, we have to change the wiring. and government should do somthing about it, we are really not free, we have fuckedup phychological disablity and defect.

because of the phychological pressure of gulami we as humans tend to go towards the cucle of pain pleasure.

when their is pain we run to pleasure. and we were opressed and pleasur is what kept us sane. but now we need to address this problem.
our parents are sdissatisfied with life and they married so that the could be happy, but they didnt, now they habd kids and it was fun for few years but then again this dissatisfiction. then you grew up somehow, tainted by education system and the socitel pressure of competition.(people in monarch society use to compete for better provision if the king was pleased, its the same reason your parents are compiting with each other to make way for their son so that finally the king could offer them socitel benifits.)
now you grow up and they want ot get you married because ythey need kid now,as the grandson will somehow fulfill them.. but it ads to their misery, because the parents think the wife is manuplative, wife think her mother in low is manuplatiove and you live in a rotten hell, hpoing to fulfill yourself. and now you think to hell with the parents i will raise my kid better then them.

and then you  send them to their school and then you want then to enter college after 12th and then job.

same cycle under your nose, if you think above centence is absurd you are going great. but if you are someone who find tis right. let me ask you a question. 

can you give your child two years gap after twelth so that ke can explore the world even through internet and try countless f things befoe he finally decides in which direction he wants to go. can you do that or your comparing ass is getting anxiety reading this. how can you put gap year. oh man, i wished i could explore my options after twelth but i was riging on my parents anxiety as you were and your childeren will, so beware, before having children think about what kind of a father and parent you want to be.

remember this your kid will come to this planet really blank, clean slated adn he is going to be filled by your characteristics. and really let me tell you observing the kid's response to different situation i can tell what kind of parents he has.
